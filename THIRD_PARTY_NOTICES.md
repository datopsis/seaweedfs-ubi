# Third-party software and terms

The root [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE) applies to Datopsis-authored packaging
code and documentation in this repository. It does not replace the licenses or
terms of software assembled into the container image.

## SeaweedFS

The image will install the exact SeaweedFS release binary recorded in this
project's artifact lock. SeaweedFS is distributed by the SeaweedFS project under
the
[Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/blob/master/LICENSE).
SeaweedFS names and marks remain the property of their respective owners. This
independent packaging project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the
SeaweedFS project.

The shipped `weed` binary is a compiled Go artifact that statically includes its
module dependency tree. Those modules carry their own licenses, which are not
reproduced in this file. Release SBOMs must identify the dependency inventory and
licenses that the scanner can resolve from the binary, and the release license
review must cover them.

## Apache Iceberg

SeaweedFS can serve as the storage layer for Apache Iceberg tables, and upstream
also ships an Iceberg REST Catalog implementation that this image disables.
Apache Iceberg and Apache are trademarks of the Apache Software Foundation. This
project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Apache Software Foundation.

## Red Hat Universal Base Image

The base image and any installed runtime RPMs come from Red Hat UBI images and
UBI repositories. UBI content is redistributable subject to the
[Red Hat UBI terms and component licenses](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/ubi-faq).
Red Hat support is not included with this community image; eligibility depends on
the applicable subscription and supported deployment combination.

The image retains installed component license material. The OCI license
expression describes the principal packaging and SeaweedFS license relationship;
consumers must also review the SBOM, embedded notices, UBI terms, and every
component's license.

## Test and development dependencies

Fixtures used only for testing — S3 clients, table-format engines, a metadata
store, or another Datopsis image — are not redistributed by this project and
retain their own licenses and terms. Nothing referenced by a development
compose file or a test script is part of the released image.

## Release review

Before publishing a release:

1. Confirm all Red Hat packages came from approved UBI repositories and remain
   redistributable.
2. Confirm the SeaweedFS release source, license, and recorded digests match the
   artifact lock.
3. Inspect the SBOM for new packages, unknown licenses, and missing notices,
   including the Go module inventory.
4. Retain upstream copyright, license, attribution, and trademark notices.
5. Update this file when package sources, image contents, branding, or
   distribution channels change.

This notice is operational documentation, not legal advice.
